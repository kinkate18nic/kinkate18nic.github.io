By downloading, accessing, or using the RailHygiene mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

2. The Service & Anonymous Access
RailHygiene provides a platform for users to anonymously post, view, and share feedback on the hygiene of public transportation (the "Service").

Upon first use, the App assigns an anonymous identifier to your device to manage your submissions. No personal account, username, or password is required or created. Your access is tied to this anonymous identifier on your 
specific app installation.

Indian Railways, IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation), or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.
The official Indian Railways website can be found at indianrail.gov.in, and the official IRCTC website can be found at irctc.co.in.
The names Indian Railways and IRCTC, as well as related names, marks, emblems, and images, are registered trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these names is for identification purposes only and does not 
imply any association. All information within the App, including feedback and ratings, is user-generated and should not be considered official information from Indian Railways.

License to Us: By posting User Content, you grant RailHygiene a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, process, display, and aggregate your anonymous User Content in connection with the Service.

Your Responsibility: You represent and warrant that the PNR you submit is for a journey you have personally taken and that all information you provide is accurate and truthful to the best of your knowledge.

Submit feedback for a journey you did not personally take.

Provide a false, inaccurate, or malicious PNR or other journey details.

Submit content that is illegal, defamatory, obscene, or hateful.

Attempt to disrupt the service, flood it with false data, or reverse-engineer the App.

6. Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time by simply uninstalling the App from your device. We may suspend or block your anonymous identifier from accessing the Service if we believe you have violated these Terms.

7. Intellectual Property
All rights, title, and interest in and to the App (excluding User Content), including its code, design, and branding, are and will remain the exclusive property of RailHygiene.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties
The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind. We do not warrant that the information provided by users is accurate, complete, or reliable, or that the App will
be uninterrupted or error-free.

9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will RailHygiene or its affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.
